                	<h2>Recognition</h2>
                    <p>In addition to recently celebrating 30 years of service, SUA has been acknowledged for a monumental life-saving call during the 2001-2002 school year. While at a SU basketball stand-by, 3 SUA members were called upon to come to the aid of an unconscious man who they ultimately discovered was in cardiac arrest. Thinking quickly, SUA members applied and utilized an AED and restarted the man's heartbeat with a series of shocks. Care of the patient was transferred to SU Carrier Dome Medical Staff and Rural/Metro Paramedics. The patient was transported by SUA to a local area hospital, treated, and later released.</p>
                    
<p>During the 2004-2005 school year, SUA was honored as the "New York State EMS Agency of the Year". Awarded by the state's EMS council, SUA was chosen to receive this honor out of 1,127 different EMS agencies state-wide. "The award to the Syracuse University Ambulance Service is particularly impressive because it is a busy volunteer, student-operated service whose level of quality has been recognized as exemplary, first by the Regional EMS Council locally and now by an EMS committee representing the entire state," says Edward G. Wronski, Director of the New York State Department of Health's Bureau of Emergency Medical Services.</p>

			<h3>National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians</h3>
			<img src="images/nremt.jpg" align="right" />
			<p>Many of our members have met the national standards of EMT certification and are registered members of the National Registry program. While all members operating as EMTs within our organization must hold a valid and current NYS EMT certification, some will go above and beyond to meet national standards for patient care and assessment.</p>
			
			<p>The NREMT was founded in 1970 as a result of the recommendations made by the Committee on Highway Traffic Safety. This committee proposed a national certification agency to establish uniform standards for training and examination of personnel active in the delivery of emergency ambulance service.</p>

			<p>As a self-dispatched ambulance service, SUA's trained emergency calltakers and dispatchers undergo extensive protocol and policy training through the National Academy of Emergency Medical Dispatchers. Each year, a three-day class is held to certify each of our dispatchers to utilize the NAEMD MPDS protocol system, ProQA determinant software and to understand the best practices of emergency medical dispatch. </p>
			
			<p>The Emergency Medical Dispatcher (EMD) has been recognized as an essential component of effective EMS systems. Proper and timely training as well as a sound medical protocol are what help EMDs deliver quality care to the calling public with emergency medical needs.

				<h3>Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Service</h3>
			<img src="images/caas.png" align="right" />
			<p>Always striving for exemplary performance in emergency response, training and membership, Syracuse University Ambulance has initiated the preliminary steps necessary to become an accredited ambulance service in Central New York. CAAS accreditation signifies that your service has met the "gold standard" determined by the ambulance industry to be essential in a modern emergency medical services provider. These standards often exceed those established by state or local regulation.  The CAAS standards are designed to increase operational efficiency and clinical quality, while decreasing risk and liability to the organization.The process includes a comprehensive self-assessment and an independent external review of the EMS organization. This independent process provides verification to your Board of Directors, city council, medical community and others that quality care is provided to the community.</p>
