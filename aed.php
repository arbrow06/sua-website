			<h2>AED Locations</h2>
			<p>During a cardiac emergency, quick access to an Automated External Defibrillator can be the difference between life and death. The American Heart Association estimates that 446,000 people in the US fall victim to sudden cardiac arrest annually. A person experiencing cardiac arrest has no pulse indicating that the heart has suddenly stopped beating. As minutes pass, heart muscle dies and the body's vital organs are deprived of oxygen rich blood. A person receiving a defibrillation, an electric shock which is aimed at restarting the heart, within 2 to 3 minutes has a 90 percent greater chance of surviving than someone who does not receive this shock. The only device that can provide this shock is an AED.While every SUA vehicle has at least one AED on board, Syracuse University has also placed AEDs in various areas of the campus to assist those trained in CPR and defibrillation in the crucial minutes and seconds before an ambulance arrives. </p>
