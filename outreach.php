                 <h2>Campus Initiatives and Outreach</h2>
                 <p>At its core, Syracuse University is proud to be a student-run organization. Partially funded by the Student Association, SUA is constantly working to provide a necessary service for the campus. In addition to responding to medical emergencies 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, SUA also holds CPR classes, connects students to EMT classes in the area and conducts awareness activities for Resident Advisors, incoming freshman and staff members. Working closely with Syracuse University Health Services, SUA sponsors blood pressure days and assists the clinical staff with immunizations, blood drives and health screenings. </p>
                 
                 <p>SUA is designed to be a service you can count on and call in times of need... but we want to be much more than that. </p>

                 <p>Syracuse University Ambulance is committed to spreading the word about the the vital need for quick communication and rapid transport during medical emergencies. To help support this, SUA visits local public schools (in partnership with <a href="http://www.sayyessyracuse.org/">Say Yes to Education</a>) to teach students about how to call 911, what to do in an emergency and show them that calling for an ambulance doesn't need to be scary. </p>

                 <p>If you would like Syracuse University Ambulance to give a presentation at your school, business or community center, please <a href="contact.php">contact our special events supervisor</a> for more information. </p>
