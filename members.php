                    <h2>Members</h2>

<p>Syracuse University Ambulance has over 70 volunteer members that support the organization and respond to over 1,500 calls a year. Students are responsible for every step of the process from dispatching vital call data, responding to the scene of an emergency, providing high quality patient care, transporting to the hospital and training.</p>

<p>When a member joins, they begin with a probationary period that is used to get them acquainted with ambulance operations and how to be an effective member of the team. After passing a test-out, these individuals become active members and can work their way through the progression rankings to become drivers, crew chiefs, trainers and dispatchers.</p>

<p>In addition to providing a service to the SU community, Syracuse University Ambulance is a Student Association recognized student organization and receives funding and support from the operations budget.</p>

<p>While being a medical service provides advantageous skills and experience for those entering the medical field after college, the membership of Syracuse University Ambulance represents every college at SU and over 50 different majors.  </p>
